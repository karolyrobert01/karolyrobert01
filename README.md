# Hello, I'm Károly Róbert! 👋

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Debrecen, specializing in Software Engineering, and I'm expected to graduate in January 2024.

📚 On this GitHub, you'll find a collection of my university projects and personal hobby projects, showcasing my diverse interests in the world of technology.

🌐 Currently, I'm dedicated to my thesis project, where I'm building a Java Spring backend combined with an Angular frontend web application.

💻 I'm passionate about software development and love exploring new technologies and coding.

🔧 Outside of coding, I also enjoy working on cars and delving into electrical networks during my free time.

📫 Let's connect and collaborate on exciting projects, or feel free to reach out for tech-related discussions. Follow me to stay updated on my tech journey; I'm excited to learn and grow with the vibrant GitHub community. Happy coding!
